# Tri-NIT - The Debuggers - ML01

This repository serves as the dedicated space for our contributions to the Tri-NIT Hackathon, where we've undertaken the project under the ML Track: ML01.

## The Problem Statement

**ML01 - Automated Road Damage Detection for Infrastructure Maintenance**

Manual inspection of road conditions is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, leading to delays in identifying and repairing damaged roads. The goal is to develop a classification model capable of automatically detecting and categorizing road damage from images (captured through CC cameras,phone,etc.), in order to make the maintenance process efficient. The infrastructure management is enhanced by reducing the reliance on manual inspections and enabling timely and targeted repairs to ensure safe and well-maintained road networks.

**Objective:**
- The dataset has images of roads with background. The model should involve object detection to capture only roads (using YOLO or R-CNN or their combination,etc.), followed by classifying the damaged roads.

**Brownie points:**
- Deploy the model (using Firebase)
- View real-time road damage alerts generated by the model.

**Evaluation Metric:**
- Intersection over Union (IoU)
